# commands to run the backend and frontend on both macOS and Windows

📦 Backend (Django)

    ✅ 1. Setup Virtual Environment
    
    Only if env/ folder doesn't exist --
    
    For -- macOS / Linux:
            
            >> python3 -m venv env
            >> source env/bin/activate
    
    For -- Windows (Command Prompt):
    
            >> python -m venv env
            >> env\Scripts\activate
    
    For -- Windows (PowerShell):
    
            >> python -m venv env
            >> .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    
    
    ✅ 2. Install Dependencies
        # Navigate to the backend folder
            >> cd backend 
    
        #Then install Python packages:
            >> pip install -r requirement.txt
            >> pip install pymysql
    
    🔁 Note: The file is typically named requirements.txt — if yours is requirement.txt, ensure it's consistent.
    
    ✅ 3. Run Django Development Server
    
            >> python manage.py runserver
    
    🔁 You can now access your backend
